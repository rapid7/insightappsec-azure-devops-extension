    "overview": "Integrate InsightAppSec application security scans into Azure DevOps build and release pipelines",
    "description": "The Rapid7 InsightAppSec Azure DevOps extension leverages the InsightAppSec RESTful API to automate web application scanning as part of an Azure DevOps build or release pipeline. The extension provides a variety of configuration options to allow for flexibility when utilized within a pipeline. This includes options for scan timeouts, status monitoring, and gating based on the results of a completed scan. This facilitates the implementation of Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) and enables organizations to address application security as part of the software development life cycle.",
